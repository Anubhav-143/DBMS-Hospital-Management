# 🏥 Hospital Management System

## 📌 Project Description

The **Hospital Management System** is a database-driven application designed to manage hospital operations efficiently. It allows hospitals to store patient records, manage doctor information, schedule appointments, track treatments, and generate billing details.

The system ensures accurate data storage, quick retrieval, reduced paperwork, and improved patient care through structured database management.

This project demonstrates database design concepts such as **Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Diagram), relational schema design, normalization, and SQL operations including CRUD functionalities.**
